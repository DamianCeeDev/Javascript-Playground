# Javascript-Playground
This repository is made solely for me to experiment with different materials I'm learning related to Javascript. Some maybe small programs or assignments I'm doing in either CodeAcademt, freeCodeCamp, or other educational resources. This repository is not meant to be seen as any real meaningful code unless it's in a seperate folder inside Javascript Practice.
